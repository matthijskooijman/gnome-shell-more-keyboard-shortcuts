More keyboard shortcuts for Gnome Shell
=======================================
This is a simple gnome-shell extension that adds some extra keyboard
shortcuts for navigating through windows.

To install it, clone it into your ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
directory (be sure to name the directory "more-keyboard-shortcuts@stderr.nl",
matching the uuid from metadata.json). Afterwards, restart gnome-shell and
enable the extension in gnome-tweak tool (you might need to log out and in to
make is show up).

	$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
	$ git clone https://github.com/matthijskooijman/gnome-shell-more-keyboard-shortcuts.git \
	  ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/more-keyboard-shortcuts@stderr.nl

Alternatively, download a zip from github and use
gnome-tweak-tool to install it.

Configuring shortcuts needs to happen manually right now, through e.g
dconf-editor or gsettings. For those tools to know about the settings,
first link or copy the
`schemas/org.gnome.shell.extensions.more-keyboard-shortcuts.gschema.xml`
file to `/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas` or
`~/.local/share/glib-2.0/schemas` and run `glib-compile-schemas` on the
directory you installed it in. The settings then live under the
org.gnome.shell.extensions.more-keyboard-shortcuts id / path.
